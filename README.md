### INSTRUCTIONS ###

In order to compile this program, type '$ make' into the command line
while in the directory with the makefile. It should compile and link
all of the required files into an executable called "driver". In order
to run this program, type '$ ./driver' in order to run the program. The 
program will prompt the user to type in the name of the input file.
Make sure the input file is in the same directory as the program or
specify the relative path to the input file when prompted. 

The program will also prompt the user for the name and path of the
output file, just specify the name and the program will handle the 
rest. When the program is complete, it will close the files and return
control to the user. The outputs of the program will go to the specified 
output file, unless an error arises. If an error arises, it will then 
print it out to the command line. 

*** In case the program is unable to parse the input file, the program 
*** has a default run case that will run. It demonstrates the all of
*** required functions without using the input file. It will output the
*** results to an output file. 

### BUGS ###

No known bugs exist. However it is very possible that there are some with 
parsing the input file. If that occurs, there is already some code that 
demonstrates the additional functions that were required for this project.

There were a few times that I ran into an infinite loop with the count
function. I think I resolved it, but I am not sure.
